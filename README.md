# Login_Register_Simple_BackEnd
A simple project that implements a simple register and login on a website. Technologies used are Java , Spring, HTMl , CSS, JavaScript . This is a maven project, having the pom.xml for dependencies, and the application.properties for the database connection. 


The main focus of the project is to create users , save them , and give them a page according to their authentication i.e. created an admin that has a special admin page (the admin page doesnt do much, just a page that says admin). The user has the option to logout after a login. The registration and login page have certain parameters to be filled in order to make or accept the user (a valid email must be given, the user has to accept the terms of service). At the start of the project the database has 3 seed users, from which one is the admin. At the hamburger menu, after the login, the user onl has the option of logout, which just gets him on the home page. 

This project implements a simple page to showcase the login and the register of a user. The main page has a hamburger menu, with login or register options available. Not much effort was given in the front end, since its a back end project.
